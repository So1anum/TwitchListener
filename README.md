# TwitchListener
TwitchListener is an app that assists you while browsing twitch.
To install the application, you can either download all parts of the compressed zip file then extract it, or go to the mediafire link: https://www.mediafire.com/file/j01b41macooxuj7/TwitchListenerSetup.exe/file . Then run TwitchListenerSetup and continue.
The application can be used in developer mode to connect an arduino. So the software will send notifications to the arduino. To use this feature perfectly you can send me private messages.
For any questions or other you can refer to my explanatory video on youtube or send me private messages on the various social networks; Instagram: kdebonne1000, Discord: Solanum#3926, GitHub: So1num, Youtube: Solanum.
